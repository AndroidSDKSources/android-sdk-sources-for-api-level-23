 * You can either subclass {@code Thread} and overriding its {@link #run()} method,

 * In either case, the {@link #start()} method must be called to actually execute
 * the new {@code Thread}.
 *
 * <p>Each {@code Thread} has an integer priority that affect how the thread is
 * scheduled by the OS. A new thread inherits the priority of its parent.
 * A thread's priority can be set using the {@link #setPriority(int)} method.
