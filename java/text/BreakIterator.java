/**
 * Locates boundaries in text. This class defines a protocol for objects that
 * break up a piece of natural-language text according to a set of criteria.
 * Instances or subclasses of {@code BreakIterator} can be provided, for
 * example, to break a piece of text into words, sentences, or logical
 * characters according to the conventions of some language or group of
 * languages. We provide four built-in types of {@code BreakIterator}:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getSentenceInstance()} returns a {@code BreakIterator} that
 * locates boundaries between sentences. This is useful for triple-click
 * selection, for example.</li>
 * <li>{@link #getWordInstance()} returns a {@code BreakIterator} that locates
 * boundaries between words. This is useful for double-click selection or "find
 * whole words" searches. This type of {@code BreakIterator} makes sure there is
 * a boundary position at the beginning and end of each legal word (numbers
 * count as words, too). Whitespace and punctuation are kept separate from real
 * words.</li>
 * <li>{@code getLineInstance()} returns a {@code BreakIterator} that locates
 * positions where it is legal for a text editor to wrap lines. This is similar
 * to word breaking, but not the same: punctuation and whitespace are generally
 * kept with words (you don't want a line to start with whitespace, for
 * example), and some special characters can force a position to be considered a
 * line break position or prevent a position from being a line break position.</li>
 * <li>{@code getCharacterInstance()} returns a {@code BreakIterator} that
 * locates boundaries between logical characters. Because of the structure of
 * the Unicode encoding, a logical character may be stored internally as more
 * than one Unicode code point. (A with an umlaut may be stored as an a followed
 * by a separate combining umlaut character, for example, but the user still
 * thinks of it as one character.) This iterator allows various processes
 * (especially text editors) to treat as characters the units of text that a
 * user would think of as characters, rather than the units of text that the
 * computer sees as "characters".</li>
 * </ul> {@code BreakIterator}'s interface follows an "iterator" model (hence
 * the name), meaning it has a concept of a "current position" and methods like
 * {@code first()}, {@code last()}, {@code next()}, and {@code previous()} that
 * update the current position. All {@code BreakIterator}s uphold the following
 * invariants:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The beginning and end of the text are always treated as boundary
 * positions.</li>
 * <li>The current position of the iterator is always a boundary position
 * (random- access methods move the iterator to the nearest boundary position
 * before or after the specified position, not <i>to</i> the specified
 * position).</li>
 * <li>{@code DONE} is used as a flag to indicate when iteration has stopped.
 * {@code DONE} is only returned when the current position is the end of the
 * text and the user calls {@code next()}, or when the current position is the
 * beginning of the text and the user calls {@code previous()}.</li>
 * <li>Break positions are numbered by the positions of the characters that
 * follow them. Thus, under normal circumstances, the position before the first
 * character is 0, the position after the first character is 1, and the position
 * after the last character is 1 plus the length of the string.</li>
 * <li>The client can change the position of an iterator, or the text it
 * analyzes, at will, but cannot change the behavior. If the user wants
 * different behavior, he must instantiate a new iterator.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * {@code BreakIterator} accesses the text it analyzes through a
 * {@link CharacterIterator}, which makes it possible to use {@code
 * BreakIterator} to analyze text in any text-storage vehicle that provides a
 * {@code CharacterIterator} interface.
 * <p>
 * <em>Note:</em> Some types of {@code BreakIterator} can take a long time to
 * create, and instances of {@code BreakIterator} are not currently cached by
 * the system. For optimal performance, keep instances of {@code BreakIterator}
 * around as long as it makes sense. For example, when word-wrapping a document,
 * don't create and destroy a new {@code BreakIterator} for each line. Create
 * one break iterator for the whole document (or whatever stretch of text you're
 * wrapping) and use it to do the whole job of wrapping the text.
 * <p>
 * <em>Examples</em>:
 * <p>
 * Creating and using text boundaries:
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public static void main(String args[]) {
 *     if (args.length == 1) {
 *         String stringToExamine = args[0];
 *         //print each word in order
 *         BreakIterator boundary = BreakIterator.getWordInstance();
 *         boundary.setText(stringToExamine);
 *         printEachForward(boundary, stringToExamine);
 *         //print each sentence in reverse order
 *         boundary = BreakIterator.getSentenceInstance(Locale.US);
 *         boundary.setText(stringToExamine);
 *         printEachBackward(boundary, stringToExamine);
 *         printFirst(boundary, stringToExamine);
 *         printLast(boundary, stringToExamine);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Print each element in order:
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public static void printEachForward(BreakIterator boundary, String source) {
 *     int start = boundary.first();
 *     for (int end = boundary.next(); end != BreakIterator.DONE; start = end, end = boundary.next()) {
 *         System.out.println(source.substring(start, end));
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Print each element in reverse order:
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public static void printEachBackward(BreakIterator boundary, String source) {
 *     int end = boundary.last();
 *     for (int start = boundary.previous(); start != BreakIterator.DONE; end = start, start = boundary
 *             .previous()) {
 *         System.out.println(source.substring(start, end));
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Print the first element:
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public static void printFirst(BreakIterator boundary, String source) {
 *     int start = boundary.first();
 *     int end = boundary.next();
 *     System.out.println(source.substring(start, end));
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Print the last element:
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public static void printLast(BreakIterator boundary, String source) {
 *     int end = boundary.last();
 *     int start = boundary.previous();
 *     System.out.println(source.substring(start, end));
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Print the element at a specified position:
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public static void printAt(BreakIterator boundary, int pos, String source) {
 *     int end = boundary.following(pos);
 *     int start = boundary.previous();
 *     System.out.println(source.substring(start, end));
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Find the next word:
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public static int nextWordStartAfter(int pos, String text) {
 *     BreakIterator wb = BreakIterator.getWordInstance();
 *     wb.setText(text);
 *     int last = wb.following(pos);
 *     int current = wb.next();
 *     while (current != BreakIterator.DONE) {
 *         for (int p = last; p &lt; current; p++) {
 *             if (Character.isLetter(text.charAt(p)))
 *                 return last;
 *         }
 *         last = current;
 *         current = wb.next();
 *     }
 *     return BreakIterator.DONE;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * The iterator returned by {@code BreakIterator.getWordInstance()} is unique in
 * that the break positions it returns don't represent both the start and end of
 * the thing being iterated over. That is, a sentence-break iterator returns
 * breaks that each represent the end of one sentence and the beginning of the
 * next. With the word-break iterator, the characters between two boundaries
 * might be a word, or they might be the punctuation or whitespace between two
 * words. The above code uses a simple heuristic to determine which boundary is
 * the beginning of a word: If the characters between this boundary and the next
 * boundary include at least one letter (this can be an alphabetical letter, a
 * CJK ideograph, a Hangul syllable, a Kana character, etc.), then the text
 * between this boundary and the next is a word; otherwise, it's the material
 * between words.)
