/**
 * {@code Calendar} is an abstract base class for converting between a
 * {@code Date} object and a set of integer fields such as
 * {@code YEAR}, {@code MONTH}, {@code DAY},
 * {@code HOUR}, and so on. (A {@code Date} object represents a
 * specific instant in time with millisecond precision. See {@link Date} for
 * information about the {@code Date} class.)
 *
 * <p>
 * Subclasses of {@code Calendar} interpret a {@code Date}
 * according to the rules of a specific calendar system.
 *
 * <p>
 * Like other locale-sensitive classes, {@code Calendar} provides a class
 * method, {@code getInstance}, for getting a default instance of
 * this class for general use. {@code Calendar}'s {@code getInstance} method
 * returns a calendar whose locale is based on system settings and whose time fields
 * have been initialized with the current date and time: <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>Calendar rightNow = Calendar.getInstance()</pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@code Calendar} object can produce all the time field values needed
 * to implement the date-time formatting for a particular language and calendar
 * style (for example, Japanese-Gregorian, Japanese-Traditional).
 * {@code Calendar} defines the range of values returned by certain
 * fields, as well as their meaning. For example, the first month of the year
 * has value {@code MONTH} == {@code JANUARY} for all calendars.
 * Other values are defined by the concrete subclass, such as {@code ERA}
 * and {@code YEAR}. See individual field documentation and subclass
 * documentation for details.
 *
 * <p>
 * When a {@code Calendar} is <em>lenient</em>, it accepts a wider
 * range of field values than it produces. For example, a lenient
 * {@code GregorianCalendar} interprets {@code MONTH} ==
 * {@code JANUARY}, {@code DAY_OF_MONTH} == 32 as February 1. A
 * non-lenient {@code GregorianCalendar} throws an exception when given
 * out-of-range field settings. When calendars recompute field values for return
 * by {@code get()}, they normalize them. For example, a
 * {@code GregorianCalendar} always produces {@code DAY_OF_MONTH}
 * values between 1 and the length of the month.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code Calendar} defines a locale-specific seven day week using two
 * parameters: the first day of the week and the minimal days in first week
 * (from 1 to 7). These numbers are taken from the locale resource data when a
 * {@code Calendar} is constructed. They may also be specified explicitly
 * through the API.
 *
 * <p>
 * When setting or getting the {@code WEEK_OF_MONTH} or
 * {@code WEEK_OF_YEAR} fields, {@code Calendar} must determine
 * the first week of the month or year as a reference point. The first week of a
 * month or year is defined as the earliest seven day period beginning on
 * {@code getFirstDayOfWeek()} and containing at least
 * {@code getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()} days of that month or year. Weeks
 * numbered ..., -1, 0 precede the first week; weeks numbered 2, 3,... follow
 * it. Note that the normalized numbering returned by {@code get()} may
 * be different. For example, a specific {@code Calendar} subclass may
 * designate the week before week 1 of a year as week <em>n</em> of the
 * previous year.
 *
 * <p>
 * When computing a {@code Date} from time fields, two special
 * circumstances may arise: there may be insufficient information to compute the
 * {@code Date} (such as only year and month but no day in the month), or
 * there may be inconsistent information (such as "Tuesday, July 15, 1996" --
 * July 15, 1996 is actually a Monday).
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Insufficient information.</strong> The calendar will use default
 * information to specify the missing fields. This may vary by calendar; for the
 * Gregorian calendar, the default for a field is the same as that of the start
 * of the epoch: i.e., YEAR = 1970, MONTH = JANUARY, DATE = 1, etc.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Inconsistent information.</strong> If fields conflict, the calendar
 * will give preference to fields set more recently. For example, when
 * determining the day, the calendar will look for one of the following
 * combinations of fields. The most recent combination, as determined by the
 * most recently set single field, will be used.
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * MONTH + DAY_OF_MONTH
 * MONTH + WEEK_OF_MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK
 * MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK
 * DAY_OF_YEAR
 * DAY_OF_WEEK + WEEK_OF_YEAR</pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * For the time of day:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * HOUR_OF_DAY
 * AM_PM + HOUR</pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> There are certain possible ambiguities in
 * interpretation of certain singular times, which are resolved in the following
 * ways:
 * <ol>
 * <li> 24:00:00 "belongs" to the following day. That is, 23:59 on Dec 31, 1969
 * &lt; 24:00 on Jan 1, 1970 &lt; 24:01:00 on Jan 1, 1970 form a sequence of
 * three consecutive minutes in time.
 *
 * <li> Although historically not precise, midnight also belongs to "am", and
 * noon belongs to "pm", so on the same day, we have 12:00 am (midnight) &lt; 12:01 am,
 * and 12:00 pm (noon) &lt; 12:01 pm
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * The date or time format strings are not part of the definition of a calendar,
 * as those must be modifiable or overridable by the user at runtime. Use
 * {@link java.text.DateFormat} to format dates.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Field manipulation methods</strong>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code Calendar} fields can be changed using three methods:
 * {@code set()}, {@code add()}, and {@code roll()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>{@code set(f, value)}</strong> changes field {@code f}
 * to {@code value}. In addition, it sets an internal member variable to
 * indicate that field {@code f} has been changed. Although field
 * {@code f} is changed immediately, the calendar's milliseconds is not
 * recomputed until the next call to {@code get()},
 * {@code getTime()}, or {@code getTimeInMillis()} is made. Thus,
 * multiple calls to {@code set()} do not trigger multiple, unnecessary
 * computations. As a result of changing a field using {@code set()},
 * other fields may also change, depending on the field, the field value, and
 * the calendar system. In addition, {@code get(f)} will not necessarily
 * return {@code value} after the fields have been recomputed. The
 * specifics are determined by the concrete calendar class.
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Example</em>: Consider a {@code GregorianCalendar} originally
 * set to August 31, 1999. Calling <code>set(Calendar.MONTH,
 * Calendar.SEPTEMBER)</code>
 * sets the calendar to September 31, 1999. This is a temporary internal
 * representation that resolves to October 1, 1999 if {@code getTime()}is
 * then called. However, a call to {@code set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 30)}
 * before the call to {@code getTime()} sets the calendar to September
 * 30, 1999, since no recomputation occurs after {@code set()} itself.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>{@code add(f, delta)}</strong> adds {@code delta} to
 * field {@code f}. This is equivalent to calling <code>set(f,
 * get(f) + delta)</code>
 * with two adjustments:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Add rule 1</strong>. The value of field {@code f} after the
 * call minus the value of field {@code f} before the call is
 * {@code delta}, modulo any overflow that has occurred in field
 * {@code f}. Overflow occurs when a field value exceeds its range and,
 * as a result, the next larger field is incremented or decremented and the
 * field value is adjusted back into its range.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Add rule 2</strong>. If a smaller field is expected to be invariant,
 * but &nbsp; it is impossible for it to be equal to its prior value because of
 * changes in its minimum or maximum after field {@code f} is changed,
 * then its value is adjusted to be as close as possible to its expected value.
 * A smaller field represents a smaller unit of time. {@code HOUR} is a
 * smaller field than {@code DAY_OF_MONTH}. No adjustment is made to
 * smaller fields that are not expected to be invariant. The calendar system
 * determines what fields are expected to be invariant.
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * In addition, unlike {@code set()}, {@code add()} forces an
 * immediate recomputation of the calendar's milliseconds and all fields.
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Example</em>: Consider a {@code GregorianCalendar} originally
 * set to August 31, 1999. Calling {@code add(Calendar.MONTH, 13)} sets
 * the calendar to September 30, 2000. <strong>Add rule 1</strong> sets the
 * {@code MONTH} field to September, since adding 13 months to August
 * gives September of the next year. Since {@code DAY_OF_MONTH} cannot be
 * 31 in September in a {@code GregorianCalendar}, <strong>add rule 2</strong>
 * sets the {@code DAY_OF_MONTH} to 30, the closest possible value.
 * Although it is a smaller field, {@code DAY_OF_WEEK} is not adjusted by
 * rule 2, since it is expected to change when the month changes in a
 * {@code GregorianCalendar}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>{@code roll(f, delta)}</strong> adds {@code delta} to
 * field {@code f} without changing larger fields. This is equivalent to
 * calling {@code add(f, delta)} with the following adjustment:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Roll rule</strong>. Larger fields are unchanged after the call. A
 * larger field represents a larger unit of time. {@code DAY_OF_MONTH} is
 * a larger field than {@code HOUR}.
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Example</em>: Consider a {@code GregorianCalendar} originally
 * set to August 31, 1999. Calling <code>roll(Calendar.MONTH,
 * 8)</code> sets
 * the calendar to April 30, <strong>1999</strong>. Add rule 1 sets the
 * {@code MONTH} field to April. Using a {@code GregorianCalendar},
 * the {@code DAY_OF_MONTH} cannot be 31 in the month April. Add rule 2
 * sets it to the closest possible value, 30. Finally, the <strong>roll rule</strong>
 * maintains the {@code YEAR} field value of 1999.
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Example</em>: Consider a {@code GregorianCalendar} originally
 * set to Sunday June 6, 1999. Calling
 * {@code roll(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1)} sets the calendar to Tuesday
 * June 1, 1999, whereas calling {@code add(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1)}
 * sets the calendar to Sunday May 30, 1999. This is because the roll rule
 * imposes an additional constraint: The {@code MONTH} must not change
 * when the {@code WEEK_OF_MONTH} is rolled. Taken together with add rule
 * 1, the resultant date must be between Tuesday June 1 and Saturday June 5.
 * According to add rule 2, the {@code DAY_OF_WEEK}, an invariant when
 * changing the {@code WEEK_OF_MONTH}, is set to Tuesday, the closest
 * possible value to Sunday (where Sunday is the first day of the week).
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Usage model</strong>. To motivate the behavior of {@code add()}
 * and {@code roll()}, consider a user interface component with
 * increment and decrement buttons for the month, day, and year, and an
 * underlying {@code GregorianCalendar}. If the interface reads January
 * 31, 1999 and the user presses the month increment button, what should it
 * read? If the underlying implementation uses {@code set()}, it might
 * read March 3, 1999. A better result would be February 28, 1999. Furthermore,
 * if the user presses the month increment button again, it should read March
 * 31, 1999, not March 28, 1999. By saving the original date and using either
 * {@code add()} or {@code roll()}, depending on whether larger
 * fields should be affected, the user interface can behave as most users will
 * intuitively expect.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> You should always use {@code roll} and {@code add} rather than
 * attempting to perform arithmetic operations directly on the fields of a
 * <tt>Calendar</tt>. It is quite possible for <tt>Calendar</tt> subclasses
 * to have fields with non-linear behavior, for example missing months or days
 * during non-leap years. The subclasses' <tt>add</tt> and <tt>roll</tt>
 * methods will take this into account, while simple arithmetic manipulations
 * may give invalid results.
